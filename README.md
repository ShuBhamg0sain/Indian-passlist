Whenever you want to brute force, you find or create a suitable wordlist.
Same happened to me also when I searched the internet for wordlists I found very awesome ones but mostly they were from foreign countries and people in my country (India) are less likely to keep those as passwords which are more personalized because of the user’s region.
E.g. names of people, favorite team, places or role models …

So I decided to create my own wordlist which contains passwords specifically hacked in India to make it suitable to brute force Indian passwords and study the patterns of human mindset in my region.

The passwords in this list are not arranges in any order or frequency of their usage.

Sources of passwords:
phishing,
Login credentials of an Institution.
